# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.


## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

0%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

As I mentioned before, I haven't scheduled any videos yet because I haven't watched them, but I'm willing to watch them if I have questions that I don't understand.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm staying consistent with completing the practicals and reviewing the code examples provided. I've also been proactive in asking questions to my peers when I don't understand something, which helps me stay on track.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through the practicals just to get them done. I realize that I need to take more time to fully understand the concepts behind the tasks instead of just focusing on getting the code to work.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I'm not spending enough time reviewing and testing my code before submission. I tend to submit without thoroughly checking for potential improvements or edge cases. I will focus more on debugging and refining my work before considering it complete.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I'm doing well at breaking down problems and finding logical solutions in my code. I'm also getting better at using functions and writing cleaner, more efficient code.
